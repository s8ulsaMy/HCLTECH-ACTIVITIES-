# 🪙 Coin Game – Agile Activity

## 🎯 Learning Objective
To understand:
- Self-organization  
- Focus  
- Impact of multitasking  
- Importance of small batch delivery  
- Iterative improvement  

---

## 🧰 Materials Required
A total of **20 coins**:
- 5 pennies  
- 5 nickels  
- 5 dimes  
- 5 quarters  

---

## 👥 Team Setup
The team is divided into three roles:
- Workers  
- Managers  
- Customer  

Each worker has a designated manager who measures their completion time.  
The customer records the total delivery time.

---

## ⚙️ Game Setup
- All 20 coins are placed in front of the first worker.
- All coins must face the same direction (heads up or tails up).
- Workers must use **only one hand** (preferably the non-dominant hand).

---

## 🔄 Process

### 🟡 Sequential Flipping
1. The first worker flips all the coins using one hand and passes them to the next worker.
2. The second worker flips them again and passes them forward.
3. The final worker returns the coins to the customer.

---

## ⏱️ Time Measurement
- Each manager records the time taken by their worker.
- The customer records the total time from start to final delivery.

---

## 🔁 Iterations
The activity is repeated **four times**,  
each time **reducing the batch size of coins**.

This demonstrates that:
- Smaller batches deliver faster
- Work becomes more efficient
- Focus improves performance

---

## 🧠 Agile Concepts Demonstrated
- Self-organization  
- Limiting work in progress (WIP)  
- Iterative delivery  
- Continuous improvement  
- Faster feedback  
- Focus over multitasking  

---

## 📚 Key Learnings
- Multitasking reduces efficiency.
- Smaller batches improve delivery speed.
- Focused work gives better results.
- Measuring performance helps in improvement.
- Iterations lead to process optimization.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
The Coin Game demonstrates how Agile teams improve productivity by focusing on one task at a time, working in smaller batches, and continuously inspecting and adapting their process for faster and better delivery.
