# 🏗️ Marshmallow Tower Game – Agile Activity

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this activity is to understand key Agile concepts such as:
- Iterations
- Time-boxing
- Sprint planning
- Team collaboration
- Retrospectives

---

## 👥 Team Formation
Participants are divided into teams of equal size.  
Each team works together to design and build a tower.

---

## 🧰 Materials Required
Each team is provided with:
- Marshmallows
- Uncooked spaghetti sticks

---

## 🏁 Goal
The goal is to construct the **tallest free-standing tower** using the given materials within the specified time.

---

## ⏱️ Time Box
The activity is performed within a fixed time frame of **30–45 minutes**.

Each sprint is divided into:
- **3 minutes – Planning**
- **3 minutes – Build & Test**
- **3 minutes – Retrospective**

---

## 🔄 Sprint Execution

### 🟡 Sprint 1 – Planning
- Discuss design ideas
- Decide the structure
- Prepare a rough blueprint

### 🟡 Sprint 2 – Building & Testing
- Start building the tower
- Test stability while constructing
- Improve based on observations

### 🟡 Sprint 3 – Retrospective
- Discuss what went well
- Identify what did not work
- Plan improvements for the next sprint

### 🔁 Repeat
The same cycle is repeated until the time box ends.

## 📏 Evaluation
At the end of the activity:
- The height of each tower is measured
- The tallest free-standing tower is declared the winner

---

## 🧠 Agile Concepts Demonstrated
