Ball Point Game

Learning Objective: Agile Production Process

As one of the most famous agile games, marble helps teams understand agile manufacturing processes and projects. The team should use self-organization, establish a strategy, and iterate. It can be played live with physical balls passed from side to side or virtually using a Miro board and symbols for each team member.

The aim of the game is simple: Your team will pass a ball (or several balls) around the table. Each team member must touch the ball once. When a ball goes around the table, that team scores a point.
